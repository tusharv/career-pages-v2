## Good to have
- ~~Auto suggest names in search~~
- Interface to add new company
- ~~Company with Logos and other details~~
- Locationwise search
- ~~Hosting on Github Page / Netlify / Vercel / Heroku~~

## Why?
This page will help students / job seekers to find list of companies at one place.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# Developer Notes

Favicon using Google API
```
https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain={{domain}}&sz={{size}}
```
Saving it to `logo-cache` for faster load and avoid exploiting API on every run

Webp bulk conversion using

```
    for file in logo-cache/*; do cwebp -q 100 -resize {{height}} {{width}} "$file" -o "${file%.*}.webp"; done
```
